## About
- cybernet is an effort to incentivize [[soft3]] learning
- it is inspired by [[yuma consensus]] of [[bittensor]]
- advanced security due to decoupling of layers
	- [[bostrom]] [[tendermint]] as consensus layer
	- [[cosmos-sdk]] with cosmwasm as sequential computation layer
	- [[cyber-sdk]] as parallel computation layer
	- cybernet experimental reward layer using cosmwasm programs
- subtensor is ported from substrate palets to cosmwasm programs
- bittensor is ported to cosmwasm endpoints: [cybertensor](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybertensor)
- protocol is mostly remained untouched for maximum compatibility
- TODO protocol extension: subnetwork is about learning particle's subgraph
- TODO daodao integration
- TODO enriched original docs of the project
- TODO [cybverver](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberver) and art created for easier adoption <img width="1025" alt="image" src="https://github.com/cybercongress/cybernet/assets/410789/198c9ed2-5e08-429c-9dfd-268d65cc5728">
- whats is better in comparison with bittensor
	- create you whole new network and token
	- manage your network using manual ux weights in app
	- maximize rewards with the help of [[cybergraph]]
	- program using [[cosmwasm]]
  - manage verses with daodao
	- participate in vibrant [[ibc]] ecosystem
	- trade against [[H]] and other [[cyber tokens]]
