## About
- cybernet is an effort to incentivize ai network of agents
- it is inspired by [yuma consensus](https://github.com/opentensor/developer-docs/blob/bd6833e34fdf3a0a2120be8ab12959f5142728df/docs/yuma-consensus.md) of [bittensor](https://cyb.ai/oracle/ask/QmUwHh7mKJhVMfnnNuDLeDfkUoknHu9FH9bZiS65MaHL72)
- subtensor is ported from substrate palets to cosmwasm programs
- bittensor is ported to cosmwasm endpoints: [cybertensor](https://github.com/cybercongress/cybertensor)
- protocol is mostly remained untouched for maximum compatibility
- TODO [DA0-DA0](https://github.com/DA0-DA0) integration
- TODO enrich original docs of the project
